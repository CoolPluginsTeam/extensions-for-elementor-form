Advanced form builder for Elementor Free. Also extends Elementor Pro form widget with conditional logic, country code and many extra fields.

== Description ==

**[Cool FormKit](https://coolformkit.com/?utm_source=cfkl_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=get_pro&utm_content=top_name)** is an advanced form builder for Elementor. It provides a form widget for Elementor Free and also extends the Elementor Pro form widget with additional fields and advanced features.

If you already use **Elementor Pro**, you can extend its default form widget using **Cool FormKit** (aka coolformkit) to unlock advanced features. For example, you can enhance phone fields with a [Country Code](https://coolformkit.com/features/country-code-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfkl_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=features&utm_content=country_code) and apply [Conditional Logic](https://coolformkit.com/features/conditional-logic-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfkl_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=features&utm_content=conditional_logic) to show or hide fields dynamically based on user input. You can also add a [Range Slider](https://docs.coolplugins.net/doc/range-slider-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfkl_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=docs&utm_content=range_slider) for interactive input, a [Signature Field](https://docs.coolplugins.net/doc/signature-field-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfkl_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=docs&utm_content=signature_field) for collecting e-signatures, or a [Calculator Field](https://docs.coolplugins.net/doc/calculator-field-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfkl_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=docs&utm_content=calculator_field) for creating instant estimates and quotes.  

Not just that â€” if you are using the **Hello Plus** plugin with its form widget, **Cool FormKit** also extends it with the same advanced options, making it a truly all-in-one form builder for Elementor Free, Pro, and Hello Plus.
